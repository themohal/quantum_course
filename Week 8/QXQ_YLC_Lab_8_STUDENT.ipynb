        "\n",
        "**Technical Note:** When we apply an H gate right before measuring, we can actually say that we are measuring in a different basis- the Hadamard basis. It turns out that applying an H gate is the same as if we just rotated our view of the Bloch sphere so the x-axis were pointing up and down. For this reason, we also call this the X Basis. You are not responsible for knowing this, but it is worth being aware of since a lot of the discussion about QKD involves bases.\n",
